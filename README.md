# Jumping-Santa-Game-Project
You might have played the jumping santa game or any similar version of it in childhood , that's the same I have made using python.
Here I have used the code in jumping santa.py file .
Concepts of OOPS ( classes ) have been used in class santa, class pipes etc.
I have added the other graphical assets in form of images in png files.
Sound effects for game have also been added in for multimedia files.
